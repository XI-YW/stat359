It is pretty common that \"technology\" and \"internet\" are frequently mentioned together in news contexts. At the same time, when \"internet\" is included in news topics, keywords such as \"software development teams\" or \"tech teams\" are often inevitably brought up. Therefore, I think these reasons may explain why the three words are near each other.\n",
        "- What surprises me is that \"health\" and \"election\" are extraodinarily close to each other. I guess perhaps this is because \"health\" is usually mentioned in topics like \"healthcare\" or \"health insurance\". Then both \"health\" and \"election\" are likely to have neighbor words like \"policy\" or \"government\". As a result, they are considered as similar words."

        "I notice that the cosine distance between \"large\" and \"small\" is significantly less than the distance between \"large\" and \"big\". I think this occurs probably because \"large\" and \"small\" frequently paired together in text, and they are used more consistently in technical or commercial contexts, so their context windows are almost identical. Although \"big\" is often used as a synonym for \"large\", it tends to be more informal (\"big deal\", \"big brother\"). Therefore, \"big\" may have relatively different context window from that of \"large\". Then since word embeddings actually prioritize words appearing in the same place over words having the same meaning, \"large\" and \"small\" have a closer distance."

Aftering training the model, we first identify a bias direction in the embedding sapce, often by averaging differences between pairs of words that represent opposite ends of a social attribute like \"man-woman\". For words that should be nuetual with respect to this attributem we then project their vectors onto the subspace orthogonal to the bias direction, which will effectively remove the biased component. At the same time, the words used to encode attributes can be adjusted to maintain distinguishability along that direction. This method reduces unwanted biased associations while preserving other structure."
